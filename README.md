# Portfolio optimization experiment


A little project to discover, code and present how portfolio optimization works.


## what is this project about ?

Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) is a widely used framework for constructing investment portfolios that aim to maximize returns while minimizing risk. The cornerstone of MPT is the tradeoff between expected return and variance, which lies at the heart of portfolio construction.

In MPT, an efficient portfolio is one that maximizes expected return for a given level of risk or minimizes risk for a given level of expected return. To achieve this, MPT emphasizes the importance of diversification, or spreading investments across multiple assets to reduce risk.

The modern concept of portfolio optimization was first introduced by Harry Markowitz in 1952 in his seminal paper "Portfolio Selection". Markowitz's work laid the foundation for MPT and earned him the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990.

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a physicist willing to use data in the industry

## The task in a nutshell

the task is to be able to automate a portfolio balancing.

### The objective

use a portfolio optimization framework(here pyportfolio-lib) and time serie forecasting frameworks (here Facebook Prophet)
### The results

the portfolio automatation is ready. THe code consists in 5 scripts:
-constants.py: constants used for data and list of companies
-step0.py: collecting data
-step1.py: apply forecating model
-step2.py: apply portfolio optimization
-step3.py: apply portfolio rebalancing

some figures:

### to do next
-do experiments: is this balancing process usefull? how much?
-add bonds, btc, gold
-add more stocks
-add stock classification
