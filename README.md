A little project to discover, code and present how portfolio optimization


## what is this project about ?

Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) is a widely used framework for constructing investment portfolios that aim to maximize returns while minimizing risk. The cornerstone of MPT is the tradeoff between expected return and variance, which lies at the heart of portfolio construction.

In MPT, an efficient portfolio is one that maximizes expected return for a given level of risk or minimizes risk for a given level of expected return. To achieve this, MPT emphasizes the importance of diversification, or spreading investments across multiple assets to reduce risk.

The modern concept of portfolio optimization was first introduced by Harry Markowitz in 1952 in his seminal paper "Portfolio Selection". Markowitz's work laid the foundation for MPT and earned him the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990.
